the platform enable artists who wants to protect and register a piece of art into the blockchain such as NFT, and to generate an associated certificate of authenticity in order to build a Contract around the Artpiece that is including royalties system. 

the information given around the Artpiece' life by users (Artist, Galeries, collectors) will be recorded into the Blockchain and accessible through the platform in ipfs. the Certificate of Authencity (CoA) is linked to a legal contract between users enable to deploy fair conditions and reinforce user's legal rights aside the physical transaction of the associated piece of Art. The CoA cannot be changed once it is created. The CoA Ownership will be shown in Dashboard by all the Users involved into the Legal Contract whenever a Royalties system have been set.


# POC

the website is accessible from jenko.io.

once registered, the Artist can upload an Artpiece and create Artpiece certificate of authenthicity.

the Artpiece is certified and ready to be transfered to ("the Parties" : an agent, a galery, a Collector) with associated Contract that includes Royalties system.

"A Partie", once registered, accept the Legal Contract, and obtain the certificate of Authencity  once the Artpiece' property is transfered.

"Another Partie", once registered, accept the Legal Contract, and obtain the certificate of Authencity Ownership once the Artpiece' property is transfered.

"Another Partie etc .." once registered, accept the Legal Contract, and obtain the certificate of Authencity Ownership once the Artpiece' property is transfered. 

the payment system in fiat must be included once clicking on create (last step of Artpiece creation). this payment will not be necessary for each piece if the Artist buy a credit of XX Artpiece. 

The royalties system will be simulated in each user profile, upon the price recorded for each transaction. 

We Keep the privacy such as management system connected to user profil. exploration page will be needed.
