        <p class="text-lightGay mt-2">

        <h3 class="text-3xl text-textGray mt-4 underline">The Concept</h3>
        <p class="text-lightGay mt-2">
          AFT is designed to change the nature of Work from a Product toward a Fruit !
        </p>
        <p class="text-lightGay mt-2">
          Indeed, when no special qualification is defined during the sale & transfer from one to another, the subjective nature of a physical Artwork is therefore considered as a Product. However, once the AFT Agreement is set alongside the Artwork by an Artist, when agreed by Parties, the Artist reserves rights for the value makers (the Artist, the Platform, the Galleries, the Collectors, the Beneficiary and other Art professionals). To provide a means to this end, the AFT Agreement and Jenko Smart Contrat together aim to autonomously enforce the Parties to respect the terms of Agreement during the transfer of AFT Certificate of Authenticity (NFT ERC721) that includes an autonomous Royalties system and all in one package to enforce the application of Intellectual Property rights while reducing the friction.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lightGay mt-2">
          The AFT Agreement defines the terms & conditions of Artwork’s summation, similar to digital platforms practices, by requesting users to validate the conditions to transform the data in cash before the use. All reserved rights defined in AFT Agreement prevails legally to any other contradicted terms & conditions agreed beyond the creation date of associated Certificate of Authenticity powered by Jenko.io. Therefore, what are you waiting to defend your rights against the abusive conditions of platforms ?
